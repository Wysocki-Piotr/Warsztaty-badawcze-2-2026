# Datasets

## With multiple concepts

### CelebA

**Link**: [Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2015/html/Liu_Deep_Learning_Face_ICCV_2015_paper.html)

**Short Description**: The dataset contains images of celebrities, annotated with 40 attributes (concepts), along with landmarks and bounding boxes (irrelevant for the concept detection task). The dataset is **super** popular for various tasks in machine learning, like segmentation, image generation, bias detection, etc. Notably, it has no explicit classes for the classification task. However, one can use any of the 40 attributes for classification.

**Volume metrics**: Number of images: 202,599; number of unique persons: 10,177 celebrities; number of concepts: 40 per image

**Concepts available**: `bald`, `no beard`, `mustache`, `chubby`, `smiling`, `attractive`, etc. *A known issue* is that some concepts are arbitrary (e.g., `young`, `attractive`) or mislabeled. The methodology of labelling is not clear. The full list is provided below.

| Attribute | Description | Attribute | Description |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| 5_o_Clock_Shadow | Visible beard shadow | Goatee | Goatee beard |
| Arched_Eyebrows | Eyebrows arched upward | Gray_Hair | Gray hair color |
| Attractive | Subject perceived as attractive | Heavy_Makeup | Noticeable makeup |
| Bags_Under_Eyes | Visible under-eye bags | High_Cheekbones | Prominent cheekbones |
| Bald | No hair on scalp | Male | Male gender |
| Bangs | Hair covering forehead | Mouth_Slightly_Open | Mouth slightly open |
| Big_Lips | Relatively large lips | Mustache | Mustache present |
| Big_Nose | Relatively large nose | Narrow_Eyes | Narrow eye shape |
| Black_Hair | Black hair color | No_Beard | No facial hair |
| Blond_Hair | Blond hair color | Oval_Face | Oval face shape |
| Blurry | Image is blurry | Pale_Skin | Light/pale skin tone |
| Brown_Hair | Brown hair color | Pointy_Nose | Sharp nose shape |
| Bushy_Eyebrows | Thick eyebrows | Receding_Hairline | Hairline receding |
| Chubby | Full/round face | Rosy_Cheeks | Pinkish cheeks |
| Double_Chin | Visible double chin | Sideburns | Sideburn facial hair |
| Eyeglasses | Wearing eyeglasses | Smiling | Subject smiling |
| Wearing_Earrings | Wearing earrings | Straight_Hair | Straight hair texture |
| Wearing_Hat | Wearing a hat | Wavy_Hair | Wavy hair texture |
| Wearing_Lipstick | Wearing lipstick | Wearing_Necklace | Wearing necklace |
| Wearing_Necktie | Wearing necktie | Young | Subject appears young |

**Why is it relevant?**: Concepts are self-explanatory and do not require an expert's knowledge to state hypotheses about their relations. It is used almost everywhere in computer vision research as a good benchmarking standard. **Hypothesis to be evaluated**:

- Do `no beard` and `goatee`, etc., are truly hierarchical? Can we do better CAVs for these concepts?
- Are there other relations of concepts? E.g., `heavy makeup` and `lipstick` should be related
- CelebA is known for its biases (e.g., one of the genders has typically blonde hair). Can we remove them?

**Known biases**:

1. models tend to predict blonde people as women ([link to paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/2ecc80084c96cc25b11b0ab995c25f47-Abstract-Conference.html))
2. models tend to predict smiling based on gender ([link to paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Distributionally_Generative_Augmentation_for_Fair_Facial_Attribute_Classification_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf))

**Known hiearchies**:

*Note: the hierarchies are found statistically as "$A \rightarrow B$ if B is present in >99% observations with A, and A is present in <99% observations with B" to remove "if and only if" situations.*

1. `5_o_Clock_Shadow` $\rightarrow$ $\lnot$ `No_Beard`
2. `Goatee` $\rightarrow$ $\lnot$ `No_Beard`
3. `5_o_Clock_Shadow` $\rightarrow$ `Male`
4. `Bald` $\rightarrow$ `Male`
5. `Goatee` $\rightarrow$ `Male`
6. `Heavy_Makeup` $\rightarrow$ `No_Beard`
7. `Mustache` $\rightarrow$ `Male`
8. `Rosy_Cheeks` $\rightarrow$ `No_Beard`
9. `Sideburns` $\rightarrow$ `Male`
10. `Wearing_Lipstick` $\rightarrow$ `No_Beard`
11. `Wearing_Necktie` $\rightarrow$ `Male`
